            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Febnyxzk7cXlTWgRoYpUYQ.jpeg" /></figure><h4><em>Using the new and improved AnimatedVectorDrawable to pause and seek your animations.</em></h4><h3>AnimatedVectorDrawable</h3><p>Android SDK 21 introduced both the VectorDrawable and the AnimatedVectorDrawable. This allowed you to use vector assets within your app, and even animate them.</p><p>They’ve iterated on these since then, but AnimatedVectorDrawable was still missing something. You couldn’t manipulate and control the animation. There was no pause or seek functionality.</p><h3>Core-Animation</h3><p>The Android team has been hard at work backporting the framework Animator APIs. They have created a separate unbundled AndroidX library called Core-Animation.</p><p>The Animator APIs have been around for some time. But they didn’t provide the capabilities needed for this pause and seek functionality. So they needed to be unbundled and then iterated on.</p><h3>Vectordrawable-Seekable</h3><p>Once Core-Animation was available the Android team could create the Vectordrawable-Seekable library. This library revolves around the class SeekableAnimatedVectorDrawable.</p><p>Under the hood, this class uses the AnimatorSet and subsequently Animator from Core-Animation. These provide the pause and seek functionality.</p><h3>How to</h3><h4>Create the vector</h4><p>Firstly, you need a vector asset of the image you wish to animate. This works best if it is simple and optimised.</p><p>See these resources for information on optimising assets:</p><p>- <a href="https://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/creating-vector-drawables-android">https://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/creating-vector-drawables-android</a></p><p>- <a href="https://arturdryomov.dev/posts/optimizing-android-vector-images/">https://arturdryomov.dev/posts/optimizing-android-vector-images/</a></p><p>For this example I am going to use an Android:</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/c1f49ee65961374471c7019479d595cf/href">https://medium.com/media/c1f49ee65961374471c7019479d595cf/href</a></iframe><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/944/0*So5ZkO11SRkrkvWH.png" /></figure><p>This XML file should be placed in your res/drawable directory.</p><p>Notice the group names, as these allow us to reference each part of the image later. Notice also the pivot points defined. These define the pivot around which rotation would happen.</p><h4>Create the animation</h4><p>To define the animation itself you can create another XML file. This defines an ObjectAnimator.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/51350379510a257647e0a635938370a3/href">https://medium.com/media/51350379510a257647e0a635938370a3/href</a></iframe><p>This file goes into your res/anim directory.</p><p>You can see from the attributes that this is a rotation animation. It will repeat infinitely by going forward and then reversing and going backwards. It will rotate from 180° to 220° over 600 milliseconds each repeat.</p><h4>Create AnimatedVectorDrawable</h4><p>We can combine these two into an animated-vector. This can again be defined within an XML file.</p><iframe src="" width="0" height="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/0fb6305ca150a51e7ed1901cdcceff5e/href">https://medium.com/media/0fb6305ca150a51e7ed1901cdcceff5e/href</a></iframe><p>This XML file should be placed in your res/drawable directory.</p><p>This file connects the image and animation. The drawable is defined near the top. The animation rotation is targeting the arm-left.</p><h4>Using AnimatedVectorDrawable</h4><p>You can now use this animated-vector to display your animation on the screen.</p><p>Either set it on your ImageView via:</p><pre>app:srcCompat=&quot;@drawable/img_android_animated&quot;</pre><p>Or you can define it programmatically:</p><pre>val drawable = AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat.create(<br>    this, R.drawable.img_android_animated<br>)<br>imageView.setImageDrawable(drawable)<br>drawable.start()</pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Rum8AFs1qaNsEC-O.gif" /></figure><h4>Converting to SeekableAnimatedVectorDrawable</h4><p>Instead of creating an AnimatedVectorDrawable from your XML, create a SeekableAnimatedVectorDrawable:</p><pre>val drawable = SeekableAnimatedVectorDrawable.create(<br>    this, R.drawable.img_android_animated<br>)<br>imageView.setImageDrawable(drawable)<br>drawable.start()</pre><p>Now you have access to pause seek functionality.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F415890449%3Fapp_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F415890449&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F889531205_960.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="970" height="2048" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/ccaec0591db3af0e80def8e14b37e5fe/href">https://medium.com/media/ccaec0591db3af0e80def8e14b37e5fe/href</a></iframe><p><strong>Play/Pause</strong></p><pre>drawable.pause()<br>drawable.play()</pre><p><strong>Duration</strong></p><pre>drawable.totalDuration</pre><p>Note for infinite animations this will return -1.</p><p><strong>Current Time</strong></p><pre>drawable.currentPlayTime</pre><p>This can be both gotten and set. If you set this value, the animation will be set to that time and continued if it was already running.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>These new API’s provide some interesting functionality. It unlocks some very cool and delighting animations.</p><p>Both Core-Animation and Vectordrawable-Seekable are in alpha at the time of writing. It is worth noting that Core-Animation is mostly a backport of the existing framework API’s. So arguably it should be more stable than a usual alpha release.</p><p><a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/vectordrawable">https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/vectordrawable</a> <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core">https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core</a></p><p>Now you can pause and seek to your heart’s content.</p><p><em>Previous Post</em></p><p><a href="https://android.jlelse.eu/education-through-motion-b500a77a3b5">Education through motion</a></p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/introducing-vectordrawable-seekable"><em>https://www.brightec.co.uk</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=b96ef57ffe36" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/android-news/introducing-vectordrawable-seekable-b96ef57ffe36">Introducing Vectordrawable-Seekable</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/android-news">AndroidPub</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why we have to choose between safety and tidiness?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*tUlhQJzYu4b5rXjj.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Quick note before I begin. GitFlow, was first published by Vincent Driessen in 2010. He suggests a simpler workflow — <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a> — for the teams that do not have to support multiple versions at the same time. For further reading see the <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">post from the author himself</a>.</p><p>Most of the teams around the world have worked, work or will work with GitFlow. A good understanding of branch management and conflicts resolution can save a lot of trouble. The latter is the topic that I will focus the most in this article.</p><h3>tl;dr</h3><h4>Long living branches</h4><ul><li><strong>master</strong> — this is where stable production ready code lands. No direct commits are allowed. If you want to configure Continuous Delivery for your project, master branch is exactly the place (read how to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">hook on commits</a>). Each change on this branch must be tagged with version number.</li><li><strong>develop</strong> — this is a construction area. All new features are merged to it. This branch should be buildable all the time. If it doesn’t (for any reasons), fix it asap.</li></ul><h4>Special branches</h4><p><strong>Feature branch</strong><br>- branches off from <strong>develop</strong><br>- merges to <strong>develop</strong><br>- naming: anything but <strong>master</strong>, <strong>develop</strong>, <strong>release</strong> or <strong>hotfix</strong>; most commonly <strong>devName/JiraTicketNo</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/996/1*x1ZWfxBYKqmaziwdHj2TUg.png" /><figcaption>Feature branch</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Release branch</strong><br>- branches off from <strong>develop<br></strong>- merges to <strong>master</strong> and <strong>develop</strong><br>- naming: <strong>release</strong>, <strong>rc</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/994/1*nmpsEaFVbJGw46TQcPcYdA.png" /><figcaption>Release branch</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Hotfix branch</strong><br>- branches off from <strong>master</strong><br>- merges to <strong>master</strong> and <strong>develop</strong> or <strong>release</strong> (if exists)<br>- naming: <strong>hotfix</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ua7iUtqW0fx0R8JzETHC9Q.png" /><figcaption>Hotfix branch</figcaption></figure><h3>Conflicts</h3><p>This is the most important topic to cover. They will occur eventually — even in one-man projects; that’s right, I work with a great developer who did do just that 🙂 Anyway, I want to focus mostly on it because it’s a very marshy ground and can bring tragic effects to the project.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*04GjisZVs986ZMIYzxeuIA.png" /><figcaption>Perfect flow? Never happen!</figcaption></figure><p>I know the feature branch may look like it doesn’t follow GitFlow rules, but let me explain it.</p><blockquote>Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable. — Dwight Eisenhower</blockquote><p>Sometimes you take a bug ticket into a sprint and this bug turns out to be a big refactoring that lasts for couple of sprints. When refactoring gets big enough, this branch becomes a stand-alone version and is not included in any future sprints. It must pass all regression testing and is considered as a hotfix.</p><p>We all desire a harmony and… Let me stop you right there. Projects that run in teams are messy. Tools that we have can be a pain in ass too. Privileges, configurations, … There are just too many things that can go bad or make us workaround.</p><h3>Merging</h3><p>Even simple decision as which variant of merge to choose when working with GitFlow can be a bone of contention. Which one do you prefer?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J1fhvgyU9Xg-E_7eO0YOLA.png" /><figcaption>Merge no fast-forward / merge (fast-forward) / merge and squash</figcaption></figure><p>Each decision has its effects. Let’s discuss what they are.</p><h4><strong>Merge (default)</strong></h4><p>Simple fast-forward merge is the most messy. Depending on situation on merging branch it can look like below. Probably that is why there’s no such option on GitHub.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hVI3DLw2G8y4ekFbGv3zbQ.png" /><figcaption>Left: no fast-forward; Right fast-forward</figcaption></figure><p>On the right we have a take over of other branch’s history. Merge is quick, requires no other action. Whereas merging is effortless, searching for feature in commits that introduced it is exhausting.</p><h4><strong>Merge no fast-forward</strong></h4><p>This one always requires us to create a merge commit. No fast-forward option is set by default when working with GitHub and in long run, causes the least pain. This is preferred by Vincent in his GitFlow workflow. It displays entire history of merges. There’s one caveat though which I’ll explain in section GitFlow with GitHub.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/768/1*kYY0L3NxupMQxRA-v6HuOw.png" /><figcaption>backporting develop to release</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Merge squash</strong></h4><p>A project history given by squashing is tempting to be used as a default option. It’s just a straight line with commit dots — fantastic! But when something looks nice, it must be bitter. One merge squash can create a conflict where we expect none.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3i-g11voVaj9n9CSR0gZoQ.png" /><figcaption>Conflict on merge to master; accept changes from release branch</figcaption></figure><h4>GitFlow with GitHub</h4><p>GitHub gives us great options like e.g. protecting branches from direct commits. It’s a good practice, in my opinion, to protect two main branches <strong>master</strong> and <strong>develop</strong>. But let’s remember it’s a double-edged sword — it requires other peers to review the code — apart from blind approves 😉 — but prevents us from having a clean history.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/686/1*2uDyy33npbJ8obmCmk0M4A.png" /><figcaption>GitFlow expected result</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Clean GitFlow </strong>— expected result is as as presented. All the branches get updated by merge with no fast-forward method. The history is clean. No extra merging required. Conflicts are resolved within this merge. Unfortunately, having protected branches prevents us from such operation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/724/1*4Ps5EpssLgIqj9m_fJO7iA.png" /><figcaption>GitHub PR backporting to release (the way GitHub allows)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Merge no fast-forward</strong> — besides visual representation in a git history, this method turns out to be safe. As developers working with someone else’s businesses I suggest we stick to things that are safe rather than pretty. With this method we can very thoroughly walk through the history and study what was happening on each step.</p><p><strong>Merge squash</strong> — It’s safe to use this method for merging feature branches to develop. It makes develop branch look clean — like really clean.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7i0NKL0F0YgH-5cHRy109Q.png" /><figcaption>Develop branch with squashed feature branches</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately I cannot think of any other usage for merge squash when using GitHub’s Pull Request system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/724/1*Q2pSl_8NcGQB7eGXQ5y4Pg.png" /><figcaption>GitHub PR backporting to release (wishful thinking)</figcaption></figure><p>It would be very helpful to have merge options on GitHub PRs. Defining merge strategy would solve the issue with ugly graph when backporting (image on the left). After we updated release branch with changes from hotfix we pulled changes from develop by using merge squash (develop -&gt; release). This way we resolved the conflicts on our release branch and we should be able to merge it back to develop without any problems — in theory. It fact, commits on develop branch still cause conflicts — which shouldn’t matter anymore and we should just override changes on develop with changes from release branch. We could do it with a command below, but protected branches won’t let us push these changes to a remote.</p><pre>git checkout develop<br>git merge -s recursive -X theirs release</pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*qL4pbZBRnqMIwBUVjcD2gA.png" /><figcaption>Merge with fast-forward</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Merge fast-forward</strong> — if GitHub allowed fast-forward option we would be able to get a situation like this one. Fast Forward in this case “swaps” branch develop with release. The merge commit message is “Merging from develop into release” and that stays in the history, but there’s a saying:</p><blockquote>One picture is worth more than a thousand words.</blockquote><p>Clean GitFlow with GitHub is either unsafe or impossible — which affects history graphs. We should be aware of strengths and weaknesses of tools (and libraries) we use. Work out with your team a preferred solution and make sure everyone follows the same rules.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c675aa4f606a" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/android-news/gitflow-with-github-c675aa4f606a">GitFlow with GitHub</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/android-news">AndroidPub</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What’s inside : Who touched my phone? Android App</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hl2JNVVQKEAsCSkDYTDgNQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>This is the first article in this series <strong><em>“What’s inside my app”</em></strong><em>, </em>this series will focus on reverse-engineering and strip android apps down to their original base code -or at least try to get the original one. In each article i will be picking an android app from the play store, decompile it and lay for you all the things underneath it hood.</p><p>Feel free to suggest if you have any app and challenge me to reverse engineer it for you.</p><p>In today’s article, we will be talking about <strong><em>“Who touched my phone?”</em></strong> android app. The app has over 1 Million downloads and over 23K reviews most of them 5 stars reviews.</p><p>Who touched my phone? (WTMP) is an application with a focus on privacy, it will record for you those who are trying to snoop on your phone without you noticing, using your front camera in the background. The records on the app will allow you to see when, who and what apps did this person used while you are away.</p><p>Once you’ve installed the app, your open it, go through the different permissions dialog and then you start the app. You can dismiss the app as it’ll be running on the background, once your device went to sleep and the screen is off, it then start recording when who ever pick the phone and start using it, first by taking a picture of the person using it and also recording all the apps that person went through.</p><h3>Summary of the App</h3><p>Now this is the fun part where we’ll decompile and reverse engineer the app, for that i will be using a tool that i created <a href="https://github.com/islem19/decompile-my-APK">Decompile My Apk</a> , it’s an easy to use shell script which combines couple of other tools that helps in the process of retrieving the Java Classes from the Apk.</p><p>The repo structure, from first sight it looks well structured, lot of permissions-we’ll talk on that in a while, activities, fragments, Job scheduler, Services.</p><p>The app is developed under the MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel) architecture with Dagger for dependency injection, Data Binding (to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources) , Navigation and Lifecycle component (which is part of the Jetpack components that can manage complex navigation, transition animation and provides classes and interfaces that let you build lifecycle-aware components — which are components that can automatically adjust their behavior based on the current lifecycle state of an activity or fragment). The App also support multiple languages.</p><h3>Dependencies</h3><p>Let see which libraries and dependencies the app uses:</p><p><strong>AndroidX : </strong>it is a major improvement to the original Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library">Support Library</a>, which is no longer maintained. AndroidX packages fully replace the Support Library by providing feature parity and new libraries. it includes dependencies such as: WorkManager (API makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that must be run reliably), ViewPager(Layout manager that allows the user to flip left and right through pages of data), ViewBinding(Data Binding), Room DB, RecyclerView(A flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set), Navigation, LocalBrodcastManager(Helper to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects within your process), Lifecycle, Biometric(includes a biometric prompt UI out of the box).</p><p><strong>BillingClient : </strong>It provides convenience methods for in-app billing. You can create one instance of this class for your application and use it to process in-app billing operations.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide"><strong>Glide</strong></a><strong> : </strong>is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.</p><p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics"><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong></a><strong> :</strong> is a lightweight, realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core"><strong>FasterXML Jackson</strong></a><strong> :</strong> This project contains core low-level incremental (“streaming”) parser and generator abstractions used by <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson Data Processor</a>. It also includes the default implementation of handler types (parser, generator) that handle JSON format.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/google/gson"><strong>Gson</strong></a> <strong>:</strong> is a Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/google/dagger"><strong>Dagger</strong></a><strong> :</strong> is a fast dependency injector for Java and Android. Dagger is a compile-time framework for dependency injection. It uses no reflection or runtime bytecode generation, does all its analysis at compile-time, and generates plain Java source code.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-java"><strong>OpenCensus</strong></a><strong> : </strong>is a toolkit for collecting application performance and behavior data. It currently includes 3 apis: stats, tracing and tags.</p><h3>Permissions</h3><p><strong>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS : </strong>Android provides <em>System services</em> to access device usage history and statistics but accessing these System services are only supported from API level 21 and above, and to use it you’ll need to request this permission. Granting this permission will allow to use the API to access the app usage time as well as the network. In this case, the app uses it to keep track of the apps being launched.</p><p><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE : </strong>Due to Android battery optimizations introduced in Android 8.0 (API level 26), background services have now some important <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background.html#services">limitations</a>. Essentially, they are killed once the app is in background for a while making them worthless for our purpose of running an always-running service. One way to make your service running endlessly is by making a foreground service, which performs some operation that is noticeable to the user through a persistent notification. foreground services are use to monitor the device and keep track of what happening continuously even if the app is dismissed.</p><p><strong>CAMERA : </strong>obviously to access the camera module and be able to take pictures using front camera, you need to ask the user to grant this permission.</p><p><strong>USE_BIOMETRIC : </strong>to access the biometric module, you’ll need to declare this permission and use the Biometric Manager for different operation. In this case, the app uses it to keep track if someone is unlocking their device with the fingerprint sensor.</p><p><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE : </strong>user should implicitly asked to grant this permission, to allow to perform read and write operation on the external storage of the device.</p><p><strong>SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW :</strong> Allows an app to create windows using the type WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY, shown on top of all other apps. User should implicitly be asked to allow the app to run overlay on top of other apps.</p><p><strong>WAKE_LOCK : </strong>Allows using PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming, and avoid the app (the process) to be killed by the system on sleep mode or when screen turns off.</p><p><strong>com.android.vending.BILLING : f</strong>or In-app billing services which relies on the Google Play application and handles all communication between your application and the Google Play server. To use the Google Play application, your application must request this permission.</p><p><strong>REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES : </strong>The permission allows an application to request deleting packages.</p><p><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE : </strong>Allows applications to access information about networks and check if the different status about the network you connected on.</p><p><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED : </strong>Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. If you don&#39;t request this permission, you will not receive the broadcast at that time.</p><p><strong>INTERNET : </strong>Allows applications to open network sockets.</p><h3>General Overview of the code base</h3><p>The app is packaged and structured as follow:</p><p><strong>View : </strong>includes all the fragments that the app uses, such as AboutFragment, AuthFragment, RateAppFragment, SettingsFragment…</p><p><strong>ViewModel :</strong> it has only one view model, which is the HomeViewModel, it observes over the new reports generated by the repository and add them to the Main View, also set enable/disable app.</p><p><strong>Utils : </strong>it has different Utilities classes that are needed by the app such as: isServiceRunning(), isNetworkAvailable(), NotificationUtils….</p><p><strong>Repo : </strong>it has an interface and an AppRepository class which implement it, the Class manages the reports data, it does operations on the DAO (data access object), creates new reports, fetch, update, delete…</p><p><strong>Di : </strong>the repo includes the dagger app component and app modules needed by the app to provide dependency injection.</p><p><strong>DataBinding : </strong>generated by the Data Binding Library, which is with purpose to bind UI components in thelayouts to data sources.</p><p><strong>Database : </strong>the Room persistence library which is part of Jetpack, provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. this repo includes all the abstraction layers needed to create a Room SQLite DB. First, we have the Entity which is the model of the data saved in the DB some of the information which saved such as: beginTime, endTime, attemptsNum, photoPaths… The DAO (Data Access Object) includes all the operations done to the DB, fetch, update, add, delete…Finally, the converters, as the DB accept only primitive data type, you need to convert object data type such as Lists or Arrays to String using Gson.toJson().</p><p><strong>Core:</strong> this includes all core services and all functionality and processing used by the app is implemented in this section. you’ll get the <em>camera sub-repo</em> with all operation and services needed by the app to access the camera module. <em>screen sub-repo</em>, to monitor when the screen is off and start listening in background. <em>sync sub-repo </em>, which manages and syncs the report over at Google drive (if you enable this feature), the service includes an alarm and worker to make sure your reports are synced with your google drive in specific intervals.</p><p><strong>Adapters: </strong>these are the adapters for the RecyclerView, ViewPager… with the purpose to populate data inside whatever view is bounded to.</p><h3>Veridct and Score</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/303/1*aT4-1MpNbVNfKgo1y3uRow.png" /></figure><p>Final score, the app is very easy to reproduce and clone it functionality. from decompiling the APK file, you’ll get to understand all the logci and how it function and you can pretty easily reproduce any functionality you want.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e1e280781132" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/android-news/whats-inside-who-touched-my-phone-android-app-e1e280781132">What’s inside : Who touched my phone?

Many teams are going to relocate their projects to GitHub as I think.</p><p>If you share the same idea and look for a simple way to migrate a repo from Bitbucket or GitLab, the followings are several simple steps to accomplish this.</p><ol><li>Inside your GitHub team page, create an empty private repo with the same name of Bitbucket/GitLab repo that you want to transfer.</li><li>Copy your newly created repo link, either in HTTPS or SSH. For example, git@github.com:team-name/repo-name.git (SSH type)</li><li>Inside your local project folder, change the remote URL under.git/config ‘s file to your copied GitHub&#39;s one. The content looks similar as follows. [remote &quot;origin&quot;]<br> url = git@github.com:team-name/repo-name.git<br> fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</li><li>Do a git push: git push --all . It will push all codes and commit history on your newly GitHub repository.</li><li>Done. After that, when we push new commits, it will push to GitHub only.</li><li>The Bitbucket/GitLab repo now can be archived to ‘Read-only’ mode.</li></ol><p>Please get in touch with me via <a href="https://github.com/quangctkm9207">Github</a>.
