          This includes, but is not limited to, any warranties of
          merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The software is
          currently in an alpha state, which means it is under development and
          may contain errors, bugs, or other issues that could cause unexpected
          behavior. Therefore, we make no guarantees regarding the reliability,
          accuracy, timeliness, or suitability of the software for any
          particular purpose.

          we suspect that you have violated these terms or engaged in any

          software, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
          damages. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of
          profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.

          connected with your use of our software or your violation of these
          Terms of Service.
