        <li>
          No Warranty: The software is provided on an "as is" basis and without
          warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes, but
          is not limited to, any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
          particular purpose. The software is currently in an alpha state, which
          means it is under development and may contain errors, bugs, or other
          issues that could cause unexpected behavior. Therefore, we make no
          guarantees regarding the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, or
          suitability of the software for any particular purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prohibited Activities: You agree not to use our software for any
          illegal or unauthorized purpose. This includes but is not limited to,
          engaging in any activity that violates local, state, national, or
          international laws. You also agree not to use our software to engage
          in any activity that is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing,
          defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Termination: We reserve the right to terminate your account or access
          to our software at any time, for any reason, and without notice. This
          includes, but is not limited to, situations where we suspect that you
          have violated these terms or engaged in any prohibited activities. We
          are not responsible for any loss or damage that may occur as a result
          of account termination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limitation of Liability: In no event shall we be liable for any
          direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
          arising out of or in any way connected with the use of our software,
          even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This
          includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
          goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fair Use: We believe in fair use of our software by our users.
          However, we reserve the right to limit or terminate your use of our
          software if we believe that your usage is not consistent with fair use
          principles. Fair use includes using the software for personal use, or
          educational use. Fair use does not include using the software in a
          manner that causes harm to us or our users, or using the software in a
          way that competes with our business.

          and all claims, damages, expenses, and liabilities, including
          reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected
          with your use of our software or your violation of these Terms of
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes to Terms: We reserve the right to modify these terms at any
          time without prior notice. Your continued use of our software after
          any such modifications shall constitute your acceptance of the revised
          terms.
